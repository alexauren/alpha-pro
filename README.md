# alpha-pro
Simplified reimplementation of Goodgle DeepMind's AlphaGo for Hex and Nim. 

## AlphaGo knock-off project

This is a deep reinforcement learning project that uses montecarlo tree search with an on-policy neural network to learn how to play intelligently. The project is implemented with Hex and Nim, but the system is generalized to work with similar adversarial games. The neural network is implemented using Keras and the monte carlo tree search algorithm is implemented from scratch.
